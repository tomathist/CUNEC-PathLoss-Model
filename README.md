# CUNEC: Cell-free massive MIMO for Urban Non-stationary Environments with Correlations Channel Path Loss Model (MATLAB)

CUNEC is a modular MATLAB implementation of a **corner-aware** urban path loss model with **jointly correlated log-normal shadowing** across UEs and APs. It provides:
- **Zeroth-order** line-of-sight (LOS) path loss 
- **First-order** non-line-of-sight with one corner turn (NLOS1) path loss
- **Second-order** non-line-of-sight with two corner turns (NLOS2) path loss
- UEâ€“AP **joint correlation** of shadowing via anisotropic fields

The code is designed for cell-free massive MIMO studies.
