# CUNEC: Corner-Urban Neighborhood Channel Path-Loss Model (MATLAB)

CUNEC is a modular MATLAB implementation of a **corner-aware** urban path-loss model with **jointly correlated log-normal shadowing** across UEs and APs. It provides:
- **Zeroth-order** baseline loss (distance-only)
- **First-order** corner contribution (with near/far gating)
- **Second-order** further corner/leg contribution
- UEâ€“AP **joint correlation** of shadowing via anisotropic fields

The code is designed for cell-free/dense-AP studies and generates paper-quality figures with Monte-Carlo (MC) bands.
